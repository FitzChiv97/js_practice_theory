##The Core Concept of Saving or Copying Arrays

- JavaScript arrays are **Reference types (objects)**
- Variables don’t store the array, they store `Pointer → memory location`

I kept storing the same pointer to changing argument here: `result.push(combination)`
It resulted in : `[ [], [], [] ]`

**Spread Operator** Fixes It:
`result.push([...combination])` → creates **NEW array** in memory

So instead of:
`result[0] → ref to combination`
I get: 
`result[0] → store independent copy [1,3,6]`

Now when `combination` changes later, this copy does NOT change.

Simple Example that demonstrates the same issue:
```js
let arr = [];
let result = [];

arr.push(1);
result.push(arr);

arr.push(2);
result.push(arr);

arr.pop();
arr.pop();

console.log(result);
// [ [], [] ] - Because both entries point to the same arr
```

##Rule of Thumb

Whenever you're storing:

- partial combinations
- paths
- states
- backtracking results

You almost always need: `result.push([...combination])`

---
> You get empty arrays because every element in result references the same `combination` array, and backtracking eventually empties it.
---
