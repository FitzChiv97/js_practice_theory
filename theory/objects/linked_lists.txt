# Linked Lists and Loop Detection in JavaScript

## 1. What is a Node?

A **node** is an object that contains:

- **Data/value** (e.g., a number, string, or any value)
- **Reference to another node** (`next`)

Example:

```js
let node = {
  value: 10,
  next: null // points to the next node or null if none
};
A linked list is a chain of nodes:

nodeA -> nodeB -> nodeC -> null
2. Loop in a Linked List
A loop occurs when a node’s next points to an earlier node, instead of null:

D -> E -> F -> G
     ^       |
     |-------|
This is also called a cycle

Useful in round-robin scheduling, playlists, or game loops

Important in coding challenges to detect cycles and count their length

3. Conceptual Approach to Detect Loop Length
Traverse the linked list node by node.

Keep a record of visited nodes (e.g., a Set in JS).

The first repeated node is the start of the loop.

Count nodes inside the loop by moving along next until returning to the loop start.

Ignore the dangling piece (nodes before the loop) — they only appear once.

Analogy:

Dangling piece = straight road before the circular track

Loop = circular track

Set = notebook where you mark which nodes you’ve visited

4. Example in JavaScript
// Linked list setup
let user1 = {name: 'Jon', next: null};
let user2 = {name: 'Sam', next: null};
let user3 = {name: 'Arya', next: null};
let user4 = {name: 'Ned', next: null};
let user5 = {name: 'Robb', next: null};
let user6 = {name: 'Catelyn', next: null};
let user7 = {name: 'Varys', next: null};

// Connect dangling piece
user1.next = user2;
user2.next = user3;
user3.next = user4;

// Connect loop
user4.next = user5;
user5.next = user6;
user6.next = user7;
user7.next = user5; // creates loop

// Function to find loop length
function loop_size(node) {
  let loopedObjects = new Set();

  // Step 1: Traverse until first repeated node (loop start)
  while (!loopedObjects.has(node)) {
    loopedObjects.add(node);
    node = node.next;
  }

  // Step 2: 'node' is now the start of the loop
  let loopStart = node;
  let count = 1;
  let current = loopStart.next;

  // Step 3: Traverse the loop and count nodes
  while (current !== loopStart) {
    count++;
    current = current.next;
  }

  return count;
}

// Test
console.log(loop_size(user1)); // Output: 4
5. Key Points to Remember
node.next is a reference to another node

Linked lists don’t have indexes or length — you must traverse to access nodes

Loops in linked lists are detected by:

Keeping a Set of visited nodes

Or using two-pointer method (Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare) for optimization

Counting the loop:

Start from the first repeated node

Move forward until you return to the same node

Count each step → loop length
