josh@ubuntu20:~$ - where you are, currently in a home directory
man - manual
man man
man cd
man pwd
pwd - print name of current working directory
josh@ubuntu20:~$ pwd

          absolute path vs relative path
absolute path - is the full location to the file/folder/directory
(ex) - /home/josh
relative path - is an assumed path, the system understands where I am 
(ex) - josh@ubuntu20:~$

cd - change directory
cd /home
josh@ubuntu20: /home$ - the tilde is gone,
it shows the actual location where I located

          Key Differences and Use Cases:

Starting Point: Absolute paths start from the root (/),
while relative paths start from the current working directory.

Consistency: Absolute paths are always consistent,
while relative paths change depending on your location.

Convenience: Relative paths are often more convenient
for navigating within a localized part of the filesystem,
as they are shorter and easier to type.

Clarity: Absolute paths offer clear and precise
location information, useful in scripts or when
referring to files outside the immediate vicinity.


Special Relative Path Notations:
. (dot): Represents the current directory.
.. (dot-dot): Represents the parent directory.
~ (tilde): Represents the current user's home directory.
 
ls .   - list contents of the current directory
cd ..  - go up one level to the parent directory
cd ~   - go to the user's home directory

cd - will take you to home directory by default no matter where you're
ls - list directory contents

hidden files on linux has period (.) in front of their names
ls -a - list ALL files
clear - moves everything up in the terminal
ls -l - list a LONG view (show more info on the listed files)
ls -la 
ls -lah - puts things in a human readable format

mkdir Name - make directories
mkdir -p Linux/Ubuntu/josh- create BOTH parent and child directories
(full directory tree)
rmdir Name- remove EMPTY directory
rmdir -p Linux/Ubuntu/josh - remove WHOLE directory tree
